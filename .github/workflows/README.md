# GitHub Actions Workflows for Terraform Infrastructure

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for managing both long-lived GCP infrastructure (dev, staging, prod) and ephemeral test environments for CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

The workflow structure uses reusable workflows to ensure consistency across environments while maintaining environment-specific configurations and safety measures.

### Workflow Architecture

```
Reusable Workflows (Core Logic):
├── terraform-deploy.yml              # Handles terraform plan and apply (long-lived)
├── terraform-destroy.yml             # Handles terraform destroy operations (long-lived)
├── reusable-ephemeral-deploy.yml    # Deploy ephemeral test environments (callable)
└── reusable-ephemeral-destroy.yml   # Destroy ephemeral test environments (callable)

Long-Lived Environment Workflows:
├── dev-deploy.yml          # Deploy to dev environment
├── dev-destroy.yml         # Destroy dev environment
├── staging-deploy.yml      # Deploy to staging environment
├── staging-destroy.yml     # Destroy staging environment
├── prod-deploy.yml         # Deploy to production environment
└── prod-destroy.yml        # Destroy production environment

Ephemeral Environment Workflows:
├── ephemeral-deploy.yml    # Manual deploy ephemeral environment
└── ephemeral-destroy.yml   # Manual destroy ephemeral environment
```

## Ephemeral Test Environments

> **📘 Complete Guide:** See [environments/ephemeral/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](../../environments/ephemeral/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) for comprehensive documentation on using ephemeral environments in CI/CD pipelines.

### Quick Start for Application Repos

Application repositories can call the reusable ephemeral workflows for CI/CD testing:

```yaml
# In your app repo: .github/workflows/pr-test.yml
name: PR Tests
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: YOUR-ORG/terraform-infra/.github/workflows/reusable-ephemeral-deploy.yml@main
    with:
      environment_name: test-pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    secrets:
      GCP_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
      GCP_SA_KEY: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}

  test:
    needs: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          ${{ needs.deploy.outputs.get_credentials_command }}
          kubectl apply -f k8s/
          # Run your tests...

  cleanup:
    needs: [deploy, test]
    if: always()
    uses: YOUR-ORG/terraform-infra/.github/workflows/reusable-ephemeral-destroy.yml@main
    with:
      environment_name: test-pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
      skip_approval: true
    secrets:
      GCP_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
      GCP_SA_KEY: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
```

### Required Secrets for Ephemeral Environments

Configure in your repository (for this repo) or application repository (for external usage):

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` - GCP Project ID for ephemeral environments
- `GCP_SA_KEY` - Service Account JSON key with permissions to create GKE clusters, VPCs, etc.

### Key Features

- **Cost-Optimized**: Uses preemptible nodes, autoscaling, minimal resources
- **Fast Provisioning**: Zonal clusters deploy in 5-10 minutes
- **Isolated**: Each environment gets its own VPC
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Workflows handle resource cleanup automatically
- **Flexible**: Configurable node types, counts, and features

## Long-Lived Environment Workflows

### Deployment Workflows

#### Automatic Deployments

Deployments are automatically triggered when:
- Changes are pushed to the `main` branch that affect:
  - Environment-specific configuration (`environments/{env}/**`)
  - Shared modules (`modules/gcp/**`)
  - Workflow files themselves

### Manual Deployments

All environments support manual deployment via the GitHub Actions UI:
1. Navigate to **Actions** → **[Environment] - Deploy**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Optionally provide a reason for the deployment
4. Click **Run workflow**

### Pull Request Planning

When a PR is opened that affects an environment:
- Terraform plan is automatically generated
- Plan output is posted as a PR comment
- No infrastructure changes are applied until PR is merged

## Destroy Workflows

All destroy workflows are **manual only** and include safety confirmations.

### Dev Environment Destroy

**Trigger:** Manual workflow dispatch only

**Confirmation required:** Type `destroy-dev`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Actions** → **Dev Environment - Destroy**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter `destroy-dev` in the confirmation field
4. Provide a reason for destruction
5. Click **Run workflow**
6. Approve the deployment in the **dev-destroy** environment

### Staging Environment Destroy

**Trigger:** Manual workflow dispatch only

**Confirmation required:** Type `destroy-staging`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Actions** → **Staging Environment - Destroy**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter `destroy-staging` in the confirmation field
4. Provide a reason for destruction
5. Click **Run workflow**
6. Approve the deployment in the **staging-destroy** environment

### Production Environment Destroy

**Trigger:** Manual workflow dispatch only

**Confirmation required:**
- Type `destroy-production-permanently`
- Enter the production GCP project ID

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Actions** → **Production Environment - Destroy**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter `destroy-production-permanently` in the confirmation field
4. Enter the production GCP project ID in the secondary confirmation field
5. Provide a reason for destruction
6. Click **Run workflow**
7. Approve the deployment in the **prod-destroy** environment

## Required GitHub Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

### Development Environment
- `DEV_GCP_PROJECT_ID` - GCP Project ID for dev environment
- `DEV_GCP_SA_KEY` - Service Account JSON key for dev (with appropriate permissions)

### Staging Environment
- `STAGING_GCP_PROJECT_ID` - GCP Project ID for staging environment
- `STAGING_GCP_SA_KEY` - Service Account JSON key for staging (with appropriate permissions)

### Production Environment
- `PROD_GCP_PROJECT_ID` - GCP Project ID for production environment
- `PROD_GCP_SA_KEY` - Service Account JSON key for production (with appropriate permissions)

## Required GitHub Environments

Create the following environments in your GitHub repository settings with appropriate protection rules:

### Standard Environments (for deployments)
- `dev` - Development environment
  - Recommended: No required reviewers for faster iteration
  - Optional: Limit to main branch only

- `staging` - Staging environment
  - Recommended: At least 1 required reviewer
  - Recommended: Limit to main branch only

- `prod` - Production environment
  - **Required:** At least 2 required reviewers
  - **Required:** Limit to main branch only
  - Recommended: Add deployment branch protection

### Destroy Environments (for destroy operations)
- `dev-destroy`
  - Recommended: At least 1 required reviewer

- `staging-destroy`
  - Recommended: At least 2 required reviewers

- `prod-destroy`
  - **Required:** At least 3 required reviewers
  - **Required:** Additional wait timer (e.g., 5 minutes)

## Service Account Permissions

The GCP service accounts used in the workflows require the following IAM roles:

### Minimum Required Roles
- `roles/compute.admin` - Compute Engine management
- `roles/container.admin` - GKE cluster management
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` - Service account usage
- `roles/storage.admin` - GCS bucket management (for Terraform state)

### Additional Recommended Roles
- `roles/compute.networkAdmin` - VPC and network management
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` - Service account creation/management (if needed)

### State Bucket Permissions
Ensure the service account has read/write access to the Terraform state bucket:
- `eminent-dev-terraform-state` (for dev)
- Corresponding buckets for staging and prod

## Workflow Features

### Terraform Deploy Workflow
- ✅ Automatic formatting check
- ✅ Terraform validation
- ✅ Plan generation with artifact upload
- ✅ PR comment with plan output
- ✅ Automatic apply on main branch
- ✅ JSON output capture for downstream usage

### Terraform Destroy Workflow
- ✅ Two-stage process (plan → destroy)
- ✅ Manual approval required
- ✅ Destroy plan artifact preservation
- ✅ Environment-specific confirmations
- ✅ Additional safety for production

## Best Practices

### For Long-Lived Clusters

1. **State Management**
   - Terraform state is stored in GCS buckets
   - State is locked during operations
   - Each environment has its own state file

2. **Environment Isolation**
   - Each environment uses a separate GCP project
   - Separate service accounts per environment
   - Independent state buckets

3. **Change Management**
   - Use pull requests for all infrastructure changes
   - Review Terraform plans before merging
   - Test changes in dev before promoting to staging/prod

4. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Terraform state is version-enabled in GCS
   - Regular backups of state files
   - Keep configuration in version control

5. **Security**
   - Use environment protection rules
   - Require reviews for sensitive environments
   - Rotate service account keys regularly
   - Use least privilege for service accounts

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails on "Terraform Init"
- Check that the state bucket exists
- Verify service account has access to the state bucket
- Ensure the backend configuration in `main.tf` is correct

### Workflow Fails on "Terraform Plan"
- Verify all required secrets are configured
- Check service account permissions
- Review Terraform configuration for syntax errors

### Destroy Workflow Fails
- Ensure you've entered the correct confirmation text
- Verify you have approval from environment reviewers
- Check for resources with deletion protection enabled

### State Lock Errors
- Previous workflow may have been interrupted
- Manually release the lock in GCS if safe to do so
- Check for concurrent workflow runs

## Monitoring and Alerts

Consider setting up:
- Slack/email notifications for workflow failures
- GitHub Actions status badges in README
- Monitoring for GCP quota limits
- Cost alerts for unexpected infrastructure growth

## Maintenance

### Updating Terraform Version
Update the `terraform_version` parameter in environment-specific workflow files:

```yaml
with:
  terraform_version: '1.6.0'  # Update to desired version
```

### Updating Workflow Logic
Modify the reusable workflows (`terraform-deploy.yml`, `terraform-destroy.yml`) to apply changes across all environments.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the workflow run logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review Terraform state in GCS buckets
3. Consult the main repository documentation
